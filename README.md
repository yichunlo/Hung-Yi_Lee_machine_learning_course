# Hung-Yi Lee Machine :Learning Course

## ML 2021 Fall
I completed the course in 2021 fall with A+ grade, which gave me an overview of machine learning knowledge and skills.
All the homeworks and lectures can be found in [the official website](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/ml/2021-spring.php)

## Thanks

Thanks for my friends CHIU,YU-YANG and WANG, YU-KAI's help in the homeworks.
